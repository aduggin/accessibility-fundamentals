accessibility-fundamentals
==========================

A book about accessibility targeted at front-end developers. 

This is the home of 'Accessibility Fundamentals', an (in-progress) book about web accessibility. It is released under a [CC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)-license.

This book is inspired by Rebecca Murphey's [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/) and Addy Osmani's [Backbone Fundamentals](https://github.com/addyosmani/backbone-fundamentals) - two excellent resources that have helped spread specialist knowledge around the web development community.

The goal of this book is to create a resource to help front-end developers create accessible websites. Most developers are keen to implement accessible sites but often lack the knowledge to do it properly. Picking up this knowledge is time consuming and difficult to do as there are few up to date resources that give a full overview.

This book is a work in progress and I'd love contributions and feedback from other developers, accessibility advocates and assistive technology users.
